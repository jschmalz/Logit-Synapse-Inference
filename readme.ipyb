    "Understanding how our brain works and processes information remains an elusive and on-going research topic today. One challenge is determining the network connections between individual neurons. One approach to determine the connectivity is to infer the synaptic weight. Here, I inferred the connection (synaptic) weight between two spiking neurons with a logit model. In order to generate the data, I considered simple leaky integrate-and-fire two neuron network with a random connection (synapse) between them. The spike times of each neuron were recorded over a period of $6$ seconds, where the spike time of neuron $A$ is $t_A$ and the spike time for neuron B is $t_B$. This can easily be converted into inter-spike interval data referenced to neuron A $ISI = t_A - t_B$. Based on this data, I infer the existence of a connections using a logit regression model, where the response variable for the $i^{th}$ observation $Y_i$ is $1$ for the existence of a connection (synapse) from neuron A to neuron B and $0$ for no connection (synapse).\n"
